Hello!

Here's your pap smear graph again. On this graph, I apologize,  but there are actually 2 adjustments. So it makes it a bit harder to see your personal trend.

Adjustment #1: In August we realized that our 'Seen in the last 3 years' report was actually pulling 'Seen in the last 1 year'.

Adjustment #2: A few weeks later, we changed the age range. It had looked at at 24-65. (24 was starting at age 21 but up to 3 year interval.) It was changed to be 21 to be more consistent with guidelines.
