Quality Data: Show & Tell {tab}
Hey There,

I'm a doc at NCFP who's going to be sharing quality data from time to time. Meridios is good for looking at patient exceptions but it's cumbersome to make graphs. So I made these for you :-)

See attached graphs. It's a summary of our quality measures. Just a note: the drop in August on all the measures is that we had a glitch in our reporting. Trends tend to hold but the absolute numbers shift down afterwards. (We had thought it was pulling patients seen in the past 3 years but it was actually the past 12 months.)

NCQA 90th Percentile is our general target -- that's higher than the number that's been used for the performance bonus the past few years. That's the dotted line on the charts.

This data is already 'out there'. Insurers and patients can find this sort of data. Obviously it's a small part of good clinical care. But it's a measurable part that we've been tracking as FCN.



Some tips:

* Forward this to your CA so you can start a conversation.
Does your CA have a way of checking if outside measures (Pap, Mammo, Colonoscopy, Eye Exam) were completed?
Who runs Meridios for your personal practice?


Let me know if you have advice about how we could share quality data better!

It looks like you've been improving your Tdaps. Maybe your CA has a new process?

::jpap::
(
You've been improving your paps. Better recall? Better records retrieval? More persuasion for overdue patients?

::jmammo::
(
Looks like your mammography rate is going up. Doing a better job of reminding? Getting more records?

::jcolo::
(
Your colorectal screening has been going up. Is that more FIT or more referrals?

::jeye::
(
Your retinopathy screening has really been going up. Is that a CA-based process or PSR-based or both?

(
Looks like your pneumovax in diabetic patient has been going up this year. Is your CA getting better at checking Pneumovax status?

Looks like monofilament testing is being documented more often. Is that your CA or are you doing that?
